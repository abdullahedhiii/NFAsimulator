NFAsimulator 🤖🔄
This project is a Python Tkinter GUI-based NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton) simulator developed as part of a 4th-semester Theory of Automata course project.

Description 📝
The NFA simulator allows users to visualize and simulate the behavior of an NFA using a graphical user interface (GUI). It supports the following features:

  Input of NFA states (comma-separated, with '-' for the initial state and '+' for final states)
  Input of transitions between states along with symbols
  Visualization of the NFA graphically on a canvas
  Input of an input string to check if it is accepted or rejected by the NFA
  Error handling for invalid inputs and transitions

Requirements 🛠️
Python 3.x
Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
